# LEARNING RUST

unwrap unwrap unwrap unwrwpa urnwaurnwaprwapwraunwarawrp everything!

## Day 02

I probably could use `expect()` with proper error messages, instead of `unwrap()`. But meh, it's fine.


## Day 03

I need to learn RegEx lol.

Mentor taught me the basics.


## Day 04

Part 2 felt easier than part 1. 

Only need to find an `'A'` and then check the neighbors. 

Still not happy with my Part 1, because it's just a for loop for every of the 8 directions. Maybe I'll come back to that.


## Day 05

- `.iter().position()` is amazing!
- Also learned about `sort_by()`

Other than that, I realized that I still have this imperative mindset. I should make more use of the functional paradigm..
