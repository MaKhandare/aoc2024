# LEARNING RUST

unwrap unwrap unwrap unwrwpa urnwaurnwaprwapwraunwarawrp everything!

- day02: i could use expect with proper error messages instead of unwrap, right?... it's fiiiiiine.

- day03: i need to learn regex lol

- day04: part 2 felt easier, than part 1. only need to check for 'A' and then the neighbors. need to find a pretty solution for part 1, because i just did 8 loops lol
